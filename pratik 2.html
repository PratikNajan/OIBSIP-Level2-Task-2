<ul>
    <li>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer. He is the captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats and the vice-captain in Test cricket. He plays for Mumbai in domestic cricket and captains Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler.</li>

       <p>Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.</p>

   
       <pr><li><b>International career</b></li></pr>

    <p>In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against the West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan (187).[14] He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai </p>
       
    <li><b>2015 and 2019 Cricket World Cups</b></li>
        <p>In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final against Bangladesh.</p>
        <pr>On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 tournament in England.[34] In the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.[35][36] In the match against Sri Lanka, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in the same World Cup tournament,[37] and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries in all World Cup matches.[38] Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do so.</pr>
       
        <li><b>Twenty20 international matches</b></li>
        <p>Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring an unbeaten 50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in the quarter-finals. This enabled India to win the match by 37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, when Sharma scored 30 (not out) from 16 deliveries.</p>
        
        <li><b>Indian Premier League</b></li>
        <p>Sharma joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise, based in Hyderabad, for the sum of US$750,000 a year.[71] In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million to the Mumbai Indians.[72] He scored his only IPL century in the 2012 tournament with 109 (not out) against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[73] Under his leadership, Mumbai has won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.[74]

            Sharma has been one of the most successful players in the IPL as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai Indians, who have won the tournament five times under his leadership.[74][75] He is currently (March 2021) one of four players who have scored 5,000 career runs in the competition. Sharma has 5,200+ runs with one century and 40 half centuries and is the fourth-highest run scorer after Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and David Warner.</p>
